	<p>Based at the University of Leicester, we are a group of enthusiastic individuals aiming to inform primary school children about the importance of health living. Our main aim is to educate children in a fun and interactive manner so that they have a better understanding of a healthy lifestyle.  </p>
	<p>Currently, we aim to run a variety of sessions within local schools to include a number of classroom based activities and games that incorporate different areas of the national curriculum. </p>
<img src="pano11.jpg" alt="pano11"/>
	<p>We want to create an exciting and fun learning environment for the children to learn about food and health! We aim to leave a long lasting impression on the children, and offer our specially designed food diary filled with fun food facts, quizzes and colouring tasks.</p>
	<p>The diary provides the children with the opportunity to note down their eating habits and includes fun, easy recipes and a guide on local sports and activities. </p>

<p>This is an invaluable opportunity, makes a difference in the community and allows for the cultivation of many transferable skills. Get involved!</p>
