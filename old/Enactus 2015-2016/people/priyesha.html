<h3>Why did you join Enactus?</h3>
<p>I have done a lot of volunteering in the past and Enactus has given me an opportunity to build on this whilst also offering me a chance to experience a possible future career path. As I have an interest in teaching, I joined Project BODY as it allowed me to become more familiar within the classroom environment. An important aspect of Enactus is collaborating with the other projects, this is important as it allows the sharing of ideas amongst people of different backgrounds and interests, this gives the opportunity to progress with the project.</p>
<h3>What does your role involve?</h3>
<p>Project BODY is making young children aware of how to live a healthy lifestyle by incorporating it into the school curriculum. As leader of the project I have the responsibility of communicating with local schools and organising sessions with project volunteers to take the message of healthy eating into the community.</p>
