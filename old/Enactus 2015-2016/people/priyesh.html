<h3>Why did you join Enactus?</h3>
<p> I never initially had any intention of joining Enactus until Sheen, one of the members, approached me as asked if I would be able to create a website for them because their current one was pretty outdated. I saw this as a great opportunity to practice my skills in computer science so I accepted. As I researched into Enactus I was immediately gripped, the society looked amazing! What they did to help the various communities around the world, the ambition and entrepreneurial drive they display, and the awesome sounding socials. Getting so interested into Enactus, when the President later met me to confirm the offer, I not only accepted, but decided to join the society as their full time webmaster!</p> 
<h3>What does your role involve?</h3>	
<p> I am in charge of maintaining the super awesome and updated Enactus Leiceser website, the Facebook posts and basically ensuring that the latest news of Enactus reaches you, the students, and the corporates, as efficiently as possible through social media.</p>
