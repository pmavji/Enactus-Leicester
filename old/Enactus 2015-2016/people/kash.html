<h3>Why did you join Enactus?</h3>
<p>I originally joined Enactus in my first year as a way to meet new people and develop on a personal level. However, I stayed for so many more reasons! It has been the single most enjoyable experience of my whole time whilst at University. I have been able to meet so many interesting individuals whilst also having a genuine positive impact on disadvantaged communities. Furthermore, I have gained some fantastic transferrable skills along the way! I would strongly recommend joining Enactus for anyone who wants to make the most out of their time at University!</p>
<h3>What does your role involve?</h3>
<p>My role is to facilitate the effective running of the society. I run and chair all committee meetings, and hold other committee members to account. I also oversee Project management within the team to ensure all Projects are delivering meaningful impact. It is a challenge but I am looking forward to a great year ahead. </p>
