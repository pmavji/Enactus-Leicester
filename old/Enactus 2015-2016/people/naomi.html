<h3>Why did you join Enactus?</h3>
<p>My interest in Enactus came before I started university. I was encouraged to join by my brother, whose experiences with another Enactus team gave me an insight into the work Enactus did. I was interested in the social impact aspect of Enactus, as I have always had an interest in helping people. I particularly liked the idea of empowering people; of giving them a way improve their own standard of living. I was also impressed by the range and size of Enactus’ corporate partner companies. I knew that Enactus would give me the chance to improve my employability skills while making a difference to people’s lives.</p>
<h3>What does your role involve?</h3>
<p>My role involves supporting our Team Leader in all matters relating to the running of Enactus Leicester. Day-to-day this can include liaising with project leaders and checking progress, communicating with our committee and support network, planning and executing events, and looking at ways we can improve all aspects of the society.</p>
