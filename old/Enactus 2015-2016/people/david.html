<h3>Why did you join Enactus?</h3>
<p>When I entered in the University of Leicester I knew that my life was going to change. For the next three years, I was going to have a unique experience that I had to enjoy as much as possible. As a result, get involved in a society that shared my hobbies and passions was a priority. I knew I wanted a society where I will enjoy be a member, which I can help other people while I could develop my skills and CV. At the fresher's fair, when I saw Enactus I knew it was the society I wanted to be. A society that helps you develops individually and professionally through a real life experience. That let you help other people by a social enterprise model and that let you meet other like-minded students that want to help others.</p>
<h3>What does your role involve?</h3>
<p>My project leader functions at Operation Chandpur are to first set a clear plan of action to do over the year. Recognize possible weaknesses and strengths and what we have to do in order to get the best results. Following this, I have to identify the skills, interest and motivations of the group members in order to coordinate in the more adequate way their skills with the project objectives. In other words, get the best of each individual in order to get the best of the project.</p>
